    "This contains introductory questions about quantum mechanics. Instructions about how to answer the various supported question types can be found in the example assignment.\n",
    "1. &#x1f3b2; Multiple-Choice Questions (one or more answers, separated by spaces or commas)\n",
    "2. &#x1fa99; True/False Questions (write True/False)\n",
    "3. &#x1F5A9; Numerical answers requiring some calculation (write the numerical answer in the requested units; significant figures are not checked)\n",
    "4. &#x1f9ee; Numerical answers requiring no calculation (usually just counting) (write the answer as a number)\n",
    "4. &#x1f500; Matching Questions (write pairs sequentially).\n",

    "> **Notes:**\n",
    ">- You can upload files to show your mathematical work; you can also type mathematics using Markdown.\n",
    ">- You can use the notebook as a calculator for numerical problems; but you can also just type in your answer computed offline.\n",
    ">- You may find these [sheets containing reference data and mathematical formulas/identities](https://github.com/QC-Edu/IntroQM2022/blob/master/documents/ReferenceConstantsConversionsMath.pdf) useful.\n",
